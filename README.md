Do you have plenty of things in your pantry, but still don't know what you can make?

already have at home. You no longer have to worry about checking a hundred recipes to find something

you can make with what you have. SouSmart does it all for you and gets a usable recipe in your hands!

On the splash page, click the sign up or login buttons to either create an account or sign in to your

existing account.

Then, go to the ingredients panel in the navbar and add your ingredients to your pantry.

Then, you can search for recipes and conditionally select which ingredients in your pantry

that you would like to include in your query.

... and voila! SouSmart is helping you make the meals you didn't know you could make!
